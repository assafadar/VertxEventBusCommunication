# VertxEventBusCommunication
Vert.x event bus in-app communication model
Uses as a super light & fast, TCP based, in-app message broker using the Hazlecase culster manager.
This communication model extebds the microservices design, making it possible to divide each microservice into microservices
and scale them horizontaly as much as possible.

This is still a work in progess and supports up to 1 process of a kind. A dedicated load 
balancer will be implemented in the near future.
